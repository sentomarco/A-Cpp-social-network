# A-Cpp-social-network

<h2> Author: Marco Sento <\h2>

This project consists in the implementation of an offline social network as requirements for the Algorithm Exam at Politecnico di Torino.
This is the core of a social network, able to store many different information about the users with the minimum amount of resources, adopting an extensive use of the Standard Template Library in its 4000+ lines of code.
The social network is able to manage three different typologies of users, performing almost 30 different operations that spans from usersâ€™ management to statistical data analysis.
Many checks about the data inserted have to be performed in order to guarantee the integrity of the system.
